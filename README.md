# Make a HOL

Like [MAL](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) but you're making a HOL
proof assistant instead of a Lisp.

If you want to build your own HOL, take a look at the
[guide](./guide.md). This is largely inspired by Michael Norrish's [slides](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~kleing/teaching/thprv-04/slides/slides-HOL4.pdf)
about HOL.

I wrote one possible HOL using Moscow ML (so you can use it on your
Raspberry Pi). It is written for clarity and simplicity, to help
readers get started with an impure (but mostly functional) HOL.
